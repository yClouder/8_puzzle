# 8_puzzle

Description:
The 8-puzzle is a smaller version of the slightly better known 15-puzzle. The puzzle consists of an area divided into a grid, 3 by 3 for the 8-puzzle, 4 by 4 for the 15-puzzle. On each grid square is a tile, expect for one square which remains empty. Thus, there are eight tiles in the 8-puzzle and 15 tiles in the 15-puzzle. A tile that is next to the empty grid square can be moved into the empty space, leaving its previous position empty in turn. Tiles are numbered, 1 thru 8 for the 8-puzzle, so that each tile can be uniquely identified.

The aim of the puzzle is to achieve a given configuration of tiles from a given (different) configuration by sliding the individual tiles around the grid as described above.

I made this algorith as a task in my college.
